# 📊 Logistic Regression Model for Loan Status Prediction

This notebook demonstrates a logistic regression model built to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on user information and financial data.

# 📁 File

- `logistic_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full model pipeline from data loading to evaluation.

# 📌 Project Objective

To apply logistic regression for binary classification — predicting whether a loan application will be approved (`Yes`) or rejected (`No`).

# 🔍 Steps Included

1. Importing and exploring the dataset
2. Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling)
3. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
4. Training a logistic regression model
5. Evaluating model performance using:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score
   - Confusion matrix

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

# 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required libraries (see below)
3. Open `logistic_model.ipynb` in Jupyter
4. Run all cells to load the data, preprocess it, and train the model

# 📦 Install Requirements

Install the required libraries with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
